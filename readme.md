## FAQ

* ### How do I use it?

  Very simple! These are the steps:
  
  - Start the container and connect to [port 8006](http://localhost:8006) using your web browser.

  - Select `macOS Base System` using your keyboard to begin the installation.

  - Choose `Disk Utility` and then select the largest `Apple Inc. VirtIO Block Media` disk.

  - Click the `Erase` button to format the disk, and give it any recognizable name you like.

  - Close the current window and proceed the installation by clicking `Reinstall macOS`.
  
  - When prompted where you want to install macOS, select the disk you just created previously.
 
  - There will be several reboots, select `macOS Installer` each time until it shows your own disk.

  - After all files are copied, select your region, language, and account settings.

  - Once you see the desktop, your macOS installation is ready for use.

* ### How do I select the macOS version?

  By default, macOS Sonoma will be installed. But you can add the `VERSION` environment variable to your compose file, in order to specify an alternative macOS version to be downloaded:

  ```yaml
  environment:
    VERSION: "sonoma"
  ```

  Select from the values below:
  
  |   **Value** | **Version**    |
  |----|-----|
  | `sonoma`    | macOS Sonoma   |
  | `ventura`   | macOS Ventura  |
  | `monterey`  | macOS Monterey |
  | `big-sur`   | macOS Big Sur  |

* ### How do I change the storage location?

  To change the storage location, include the following bind mount in your compose file:

  ```yaml
  volumes:
    - /var/macos:/storage
  ```

  Replace the example path `/var/macos` with the desired storage folder.

* ### How do I change the size of the disk?

  To expand the default size of 32 GB, add the `DISK_SIZE` setting to your compose file and set it to your preferred capacity:

  ```yaml
  environment:
    DISK_SIZE: "256G"
  ```
  
  This can also be used to resize the existing disk to a larger capacity without any data loss.

* ### How do I change the amount of CPU or RAM?

  By default, the container will be allowed to use a maximum of 2 CPU cores and 3 GB of RAM.

  If you want to adjust this, you can specify the desired amount using the following environment variables:

  ```yaml
  environment:
    RAM_SIZE: "8G"
    CPU_CORES: "4"
  ```

  Please note that macOS requires the CPU core count to always be a power of 2.
 
* ### How do I verify if my system supports KVM?
  
  To verify if your system supports KVM, run the following commands:

  ```bash
  sudo apt install cpu-checker
  sudo kvm-ok
  ```

  If you receive an error from `kvm-ok` indicating that KVM acceleration can't be used, check the virtualization settings in the BIOS.

* ### Is this project legal?

  Yes, this project contains only open-source code and does not distribute any copyrighted material. So under all applicable laws, this project will be considered legal.
