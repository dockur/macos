## FAQ 💬

### How do I use it?

  Very simple! These are the steps:
  
  - Start the container and connect to [port 8006](http://127.0.0.1:8006/) using your web browser.

  - Choose `Disk Utility` and then select the largest `Apple Inc. VirtIO Block Media` disk.

  - Click the `Erase` button to format the disk to APFS, and give it any name you like.

  - Close the current window and proceed the installation by clicking `Reinstall macOS`.
  
  - When prompted where you want to install it, select the disk you created previously.
 
  - After all files are copied, select your region, language, and account settings.
  
  Enjoy your brand new machine, and don't forget to star this repo!

### How do I select the version of macOS?

  By default, macOS 13 (Ventura) will be installed, but you can add the `VERSION` environment variable in order to specify an alternative:

  ```yaml
  environment:
    VERSION: "13"
  ```

  Select from the values below:
  
  |   **Value** | **Version**    | **Name** |
  |-------------|----------------|------------------|
  | `15`        | macOS 15       | Sequoia          |
  | `14`        | macOS 14       | Sonoma           |
  | `13`        | macOS 13       | Ventura          |
  | `12`        | macOS 12       | Monterey         |
  | `11`        | macOS 11       | Big Sur          |

> [!NOTE]
> Support for macOS 15 (Sequoia) is still in its infancy, as it does not allow you to sign in to your Apple Account yet. 

### How do I change the storage location?

  To change the storage location, include the following bind mount in your compose file:

  ```yaml
  volumes:
    - ./macos:/storage
  ```

  Replace the example path `./macos` with the desired storage folder or named volume.

### How do I change the size of the disk?

  To expand the default size of 64 GB, add the `DISK_SIZE` setting to your compose file and set it to your preferred capacity:

  ```yaml
  environment:
    DISK_SIZE: "256G"
  ```
  
> [!TIP]
> This can also be used to resize the existing disk to a larger capacity without any data loss.

### How do I change the amount of CPU or RAM?

  By default, the container will be allowed to use a maximum of 2 CPU cores and 4 GB of RAM.

  If you want to adjust this, you can specify the desired amount using the following environment variables:

  ```yaml
  environment:
    RAM_SIZE: "8G"
    CPU_CORES: "4"
  ```

### How do I assign an individual IP address to the container?

  By default, the container uses bridge networking, which shares the IP address with the host. 

  If you want to assign an individual IP address to the container, you can create a macvlan network as follows:

  ```bash
  docker network create -d macvlan \
      --subnet=192.168.0.0/24 \
      --gateway=192.168.0.1 \
      --ip-range=192.168.0.100/28 \
      -o parent=eth0 vlan
  ```
  
  Be sure to modify these values to match your local subnet. 

  Once you have created the network, change your compose file to look as follows:

  ```yaml
  services:
    macos:
      container_name: macos
      ..<snip>..
      networks:
        vlan:
          ipv4_address: 192.168.0.100

  networks:
    vlan:
      external: true
  ```
 
  An added benefit of this approach is that you won't have to perform any port mapping anymore, since all ports will be exposed by default.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This IP address won't be accessible from the Docker host due to the design of macvlan, which doesn't permit communication between the two. If this is a concern, you need to create a [second macvlan](https://blog.oddbit.com/post/2018-03-12-using-docker-macvlan-networks/#host-access) as a workaround.

### How can macOS acquire an IP address from my router?

  After configuring the container for [macvlan](#how-do-i-assign-an-individual-ip-address-to-the-container), it is possible for macOS to become part of your home network by requesting an IP from your router, just like your other devices.

  To enable this mode, in which the container and macOS will have separate IP addresses, add the following lines to your compose file:

  ```yaml
  environment:
    DHCP: "Y"
  devices:
    - /dev/vhost-net
  device_cgroup_rules:
    - 'c *:* rwm'
  ```

### How do I pass-through a disk?

  It is possible to pass-through disk devices or partitions directly by adding them to your compose file in this way:

  ```yaml
  devices:
    - /dev/sdb:/disk1
    - /dev/sdc1:/disk2
  ```

  Use `/disk1` if you want it to become your main drive, and use `/disk2` and higher to add them as secondary drives.
  
### How do I pass-through a USB device?

  To pass-through a USB device, first lookup its vendor and product id via the `lsusb` command, then add them to your compose file like this:

  ```yaml
  environment:
    ARGUMENTS: "-device usb-host,vendorid=0x1234,productid=0x1234"
  devices:
    - /dev/bus/usb
  ```

### How do I share files with the host?

  To share files with the host, add the following volume to your compose file:

  ```yaml
  volumes:
    - ./example:/shared
  ```

  Then start macOS and execute the following command:
  
  ```shell
  sudo -S mount_9p shared
  ```

  In Finder’s menu bar, click on “Go – Computer” to access this shared folder, it will show the contents of `./example`.
  
### How do I verify if my system supports KVM?

  First check if your software is compatible using this chart:

  | **Product**  | **Linux** | **Win11** | **Win10** | **macOS** |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | Docker CLI        | ✅   | ✅       | ❌        | ❌ |
  | Docker Desktop    | ❌   | ✅       | ❌        | ❌ | 
  | Podman CLI        | ✅   | ✅       | ❌        | ❌ | 
  | Podman Desktop    | ✅   | ✅       | ❌        | ❌ | 

  After that you can run the following commands in Linux to check your system:

  ```bash
  sudo apt install cpu-checker
  sudo kvm-ok
  ```

  If you receive an error from `kvm-ok` indicating that KVM cannot be used, please check whether:

  - the virtualization extensions (`Intel VT-x` or `AMD SVM`) are enabled in your BIOS.

  - you enabled "nested virtualization" if you are running the container inside a virtual machine.

  - you are not using a cloud provider, as most of them do not allow nested virtualization for their VPS's.

  If you did not receive any error from `kvm-ok` but the container still complains about a missing KVM device, it could help to add `privileged: true` to your compose file (or `sudo` to your `docker` command) to rule out any permission issue.

### How do I run Windows in a container?

  You can use [dockur/windows](https://github.com/dockur/windows) for that. It shares many of the same features, and even has completely automatic installation.

### How do I run a Linux desktop in a container?

  You can use [qemus/qemu](https://github.com/qemus/qemu) in that case.

### Is this project legal?

  Yes, this project contains only open-source code and does not distribute any copyrighted material. Neither does it try to circumvent any copyright protection measures. So under all applicable laws, this project will be considered legal.

  However, by installing Apple's macOS, you must accept their end-user license agreement, which does not permit installation on non-official hardware. So only run this container on hardware sold by Apple, as any other use will be a violation of their terms and conditions.
