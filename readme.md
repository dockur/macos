## FAQ

* ### How do I use it?

  Very simple! These are the steps:
  
  - Start the container and connect to [port 8006](http://localhost:8006) using your web browser.

  - Select `macOs Base System` using your keyboard to begin the installation.

  - Select `Disk Utility` and then select the largest `Apple Inc. VirtIO Block Media` disk.

  - Click `Erase` to format the disk, and give it any recognizable name you like.

  - Close the window and proceed the installation by clicking `Reinstall macOS <version>`.
  
  - When prompted where to install the OS, select the disk you just created.

  - Once you see the desktop, your OSX installation is ready for use.
  
  Enjoy your brand new machine, and don't forget to star this repo!

* ### How do I select the OSX version?

  By default, Ventura will be installed. But you can add the `VERSION` environment variable to your compose file, in order to specify an alternative OSX version to be downloaded:

  ```yaml
  environment:
    VERSION: "ventura"
  ```

  Select from the values below:
  
  |   **Value**   | **Version**        | **Size** |
  |----|-----|----|
  | `sonoma`      | Sonoma             | ? GB     |
  | `ventura`     | Ventura            | 3.0 GB   |
  | `monterey`    | Monterey           | ? GB     |
  | `big-sur`     | Big Sur            | ? GB     |
  | `catalina`    | Catalina           | ? GB     |
  | `mojave`      | Mojave             | ? GB     |
  | `high-sierra` | High Sierra        | ? GB     |

* ### How do I change the storage location?

  To change the storage location, include the following bind mount in your compose file:

  ```yaml
  volumes:
    - /var/osx:/storage
  ```

  Replace the example path `/var/osx` with the desired storage folder.

* ### How do I change the size of the disk?

  To expand the default size of 64 GB, add the `DISK_SIZE` setting to your compose file and set it to your preferred capacity:

  ```yaml
  environment:
    DISK_SIZE: "256G"
  ```
  
  This can also be used to resize the existing disk to a larger capacity without any data loss.

* ### How do I change the amount of CPU or RAM?

  By default, the container will be allowed to use a maximum of 2 CPU cores and 4 GB of RAM.

  If you want to adjust this, you can specify the desired amount using the following environment variables:

  ```yaml
  environment:
    RAM_SIZE: "8G"
    CPU_CORES: "4"
  ```

  Please note that OSX requires the CPU core count to be a power of 2.
 
* ### How do I verify if my system supports KVM?
  
  To verify if your system supports KVM, run the following commands:

  ```bash
  sudo apt install cpu-checker
  sudo kvm-ok
  ```

  If you receive an error from `kvm-ok` indicating that KVM acceleration can't be used, check the virtualization settings in the BIOS.

* ### Is this project legal?

  Yes, this project contains only open-source code and does not distribute any copyrighted material. So under all applicable laws, this project will be considered legal.
